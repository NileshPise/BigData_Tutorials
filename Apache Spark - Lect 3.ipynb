    "    Total number of lines in the file\n",
    "\n",
    "    Total number of characters in the file\n",
    "\n",
    "To read a simple file, you can use two functions: textFile() and wholeTextFiles(). These two functions are defined on our SparkContext object.\n",
    "\n",
    "The textFile() method reads a text file and results in an RDD of lines. The textFile() method is a transformation, so textFile() does not read the data until the first action is called. Because the file is not available at the time textFile() is run, it will not throw an error. It will throw an error when the first action is called. Why is this? Like other transformations, the textFile() function will be called when the first action is called.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another method, wholeTextFiles(), works in similar way as textFile() except it reads the file as a key/value pair. The file name is read as the key, and the file data is read as the value associated with that key.\n",

    "\n",
    "A sequential file uses the key/value file format. Here, the key values are in binary format. This is a commonly used file format for Hadoop. The keys and values are types of the Hadoop Writable class.\n",
    "We have data in a sequential file in HDFS, in the sequenceFileToRead directory inside the root directory. In the file inside the directory, we have the data in Table 6-1.\n",

    "\n",
    "We can read the sequence file by using the sequenceFile() method defined in the SparkContext class.\n",
    "How It Works\n",
    "\n",
    "The sequenceFile() function takes many arguments. Let me discuss some of them. The first argument is path, which is the path of the sequential file. The second argument is keyClass, which indicates the key class of data in the sequence file. The argument valueClass represents the data type of the values. Remember that the key and value classes are children of the Hadoop Writable classes."
